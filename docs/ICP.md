**Key Motivations:**

- Cost (cheaper than Wiz/Orca)
- Simplicity (one dashboard, one score)
- Credibility (show investors/customers)

### Objections & Concerns
- "Is this as good as hiring a security person?"
- "Will this actually help us pass SOC 2?"
- "What if we outgrow this and need Wiz later?"
- "Can I trust a startup with our security data?"

### Decision Process
- **Economic buyer:** CEO or CTO
- **Technical evaluator:** Lead engineer or DevOps
- **Decision timeline:** 1-2 weeks (fast-moving startups)
- **Budget approval:** Usually <$500/month doesn't need board approval

## Anti-ICP (Who We're NOT For)

### Too Small
- Solo founders / pre-product
- <$100k in funding
- Single AWS account with basic setup
- **Why:** Not enough cloud complexity to justify tool

### Too Large
- Series B+ with >100 employees
- Dedicated security team (3+ people)
- Already using Wiz/Orca/Lacework
- **Why:** Need enterprise features we don't have yet

### Wrong Priorities
- Companies not selling to enterprises
- No compliance pressure (B2C, early stage)
- Engineering team resists paid tools
- **Why:** Won't value or pay for our solution
